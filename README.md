## üèúÔ∏è Oasis

Oasis was [Hack Club‚Äôs](hackclub.com) tenth all-female/non-binary hackathon weekend! From June 7th-8th, 7 Hack Clubbers from across the US delivered an event in Austin Texas in collaboration with the Girl Scouts of Central Texas and FUTO Headquarters, where 25 participants wrote their first lines of code. The event includes 2 workshops in Sprig Video Game Development and OnBoard PCB Design. Ahead of the hackathon, Hack Clubbers hosted a dinner with incredible female leaders from across Austin.

## üéØ Our Goals

Like past Days of Service events such as Horizon and Evergreen, we had two goals for our event:

1. To support Hack Clubbers to become more technical, become better leaders, and deepen friendships through fun, collaborative coding projects.
2. To grow Hack Club‚Äôs community so it is inclusive and accessible to teenagers of all backgrounds. We made active outreach to under-represented, marginalized gender & race minorities, who lack access to computer science programs or professional mentors in their community.

## üíª Our Workshops
Oasis had 2 different workshop tracks: Sprig Video Game Development and PCB Development! Here‚Äôs an overview of each workshop:

**Sprig Video Game Development**

In this workshop, students learned JavaScript and video game design to develop their own pixel-art video games! 

**PCB Development**

In this workshop, students learned the fundamentals of circuit board design in EasyEDA with Hack Club's OnBoard program!

## üçΩÔ∏è Our Dinner
Ahead the hackathon, we had an amazing dinner at Maie Day! In attendance were 18 STEM professionals, 8 Hack Clubbers, 7 Girl Scouts, and 2 Westlake Girls Who Code members.

We started the night off with a round of questions on topics such as how to adapt to AI, advice for managing finances and overcoming failure, and learning about inspiring side projects. This led to some great conversation about societal and gender norms, and how to navigate the workplace while dealing with this.

One of the most memorable moments from the dinner is when we discussed about how technology has made our lives harder and reconfiguring the topic into a positive statement and debate about how it's made our lives easier.
